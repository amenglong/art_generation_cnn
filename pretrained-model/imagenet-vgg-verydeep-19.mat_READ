Make sure name is "imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat"

Following the original NST paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576), we will use the VGG network. 
Specifically, we'll use VGG-19, a 19-layer version of the VGG network. 
This model has already been trained on the very large ImageNet database, and thus has learned to 
recognize a variety of low level features (at the earlier layers) and high level features (at the deeper layers).
